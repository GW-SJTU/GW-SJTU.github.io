Hi! I am Siteng Huang (黄思腾). I am a joint Ph.D. student of [Westlake University](https://www.westlake.edu.cn/) and [Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn/), advised by Dr. [Donglin Wang](https://www.westlake.edu.cn/info/1408/3011.htm). Also, I am a member of MiLAB(Machine Intelligence Lab) in Westlake University, where I do my research work. My research interests lie within robot learning, particularly in few-shot learning and transfer learning. I am also interested in sequence modeling, multimodal machine learning and deep learning.

Before coming to Westlake University, I obtained my degree of Bachelor of Engineering from [School of Computer Science](http://cs.whu.edu.cn/), [Wuhan University](https://www.whu.edu.cn/), majoring Software Engineering.

Always open to research interns (maybe after my first year of Ph.D.) and cooperation opportunities. Feel free to reach out to me if you are interested. My email address is huangsiteng [at] westlake.edu.cn.

Currently, I am also looking for **research assistants for MiLAB** as my collaborator. You can get more information about it [here](https://www.westlake.edu.cn/info/1301/3480.htm), and if you are interested in my research direction, please let me know it from the email.
