Hi! I am currently a joint Ph.D. student of [Westlake University](https://www.westlake.edu.cn/) and [Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn/), advised by Dr. [Donglin Wang](https://www.westlake.edu.cn/info/1408/3011.htm). Also, I am a member of MiLAB(Machine Intelligence Lab), where I do my research work. My research interests lie within robot learning, particularly in few-shot learning and transfer learning. I am also interested in sequence modeling, multimodal machine learning and deep learning.

Before coming to Westlake University, I received my degree of Bachelor of Engineering from [School of Computer Science](http://cs.whu.edu.cn/), [Wuhan University](https://www.whu.edu.cn/) in 2019.06, majoring Software Engineering.

Always look forward to **research intern** and cooperation opportunities. If you are interested. please don't hesitate to contact me. My information is attached below.
