Hi! I am Siteng Huang (黄思腾). I am a joint Ph.D. student of [Westlake University](https://www.westlake.edu.cn/) and [Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn/), advised by Dr. [Donglin Wang](https://en.westlake.edu.cn/about/faculty/201912/t20191206_2513.shtml). Also, I am a member of Machine Intelligence Laboratory (MiLAB) in Westlake University, where I do my research work on machine learning, few-shot learning, and robot learning. 

Before coming to Westlake University, I obtained my bachelor's degree of Engineering from School of Computer Science, [Wuhan University](https://www.whu.edu.cn/), majoring in Software Engineering.

**Research interests**: I am interested in technologies that allow machines and robots to learn like humans. In particular, I am committed to giving robots the ability to understand the world and learn from previous experiences, so that they can complete new tasks, acquire new skills or adapt to new environments rapidly with fewer samples through learning algorithms. Currently, my areas of interest include meta-learning, multi-task learning, and transfer learning. I am also interested in deep learning, computer vision, natural language processing, and multimodal machine learning.

Always open to research interns and cooperation opportunities. Feel free to reach out to me if you are interested. My email address is huangsiteng [at] westlake.edu.cn.

We are looking for **research assistants and visiting students for MiLAB** (currently only for Chinese). More information about requirements for research assistants [here](https://www.westlake.edu.cn/Careers/OpenPositions/research/202012/t20201223_7545.shtml), and if you are still in school, being a visiting student is also welcome. Please send email to `mi_lab [at] westlake.edu.cn` with your CV if you are interested. Specially, if you are interested in my research direction and would like to be my collaborator after coming, please let us know it from the email.
