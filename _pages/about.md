Hi! I am Siteng Huang (黄思腾). I am a joint Ph.D. student of [Westlake University](https://www.westlake.edu.cn/) and [Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn/), advised by Dr. [Donglin Wang](https://www.westlake.edu.cn/info/1408/3011.htm). Also, I am a member of MiLAB (Machine Intelligence Laboratory) in Westlake University, where I do my research work. My research interests lie within robot learning, especially on technologies that allow machines and robots to complete new tasks, acquire new skills or adapt to the environment rapidly with fewer samples through learning algorithms, such as few-shot learning, multi-task learning and transfer learning. I am also interested in sequence modeling, multimodal machine learning and deep learning.

Before coming to Westlake University, I obtained my degree of Bachelor of Engineering from [School of Computer Science](http://cs.whu.edu.cn/), [Wuhan University](https://www.whu.edu.cn/), majoring in Software Engineering.

Always open to research interns (after my first year of Ph.D.) and cooperation opportunities. Feel free to reach out to me if you are interested. My email address is huangsiteng [at] westlake.edu.cn.

Currently, we are looking for **research assistants and visiting students for MiLAB**. You can get more information about requirements for research assistants [here](https://www.westlake.edu.cn/info/1301/3724.htm), and if you are still in school, being a visiting student is also welcome. Specially, if you are interested in my research direction and want to be my collaborator after coming, please let us know it from the email.
